Code Assignments and Projects From My Python Class

The included programs show my ability to perform the following in Python:

String Manipulation and Methods (concatenation, slicing, split, find(), replace(),  etc.)

Control, Sequence, and Decision Structures (if, if-else, while loop, for loop, nested loops, etc)

Read/Write from external files

Functions (defining, passing arguments, returning values)

Exception Handling

Some object oriented programming was covered in this class, but more extensively in my Java class.
